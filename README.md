This tutorial introduces CPU profiling of
[IMP](https://integrativemodeling.org/) code with Google's
[gperftools](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) package,
to track down where time is being spent.

See [the IMP website](https://integrativemodeling.org/tutorials/profiling/)
for the tutorial text.
